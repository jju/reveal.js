<p>examples of activism and how things work</p>
</blockquote>
<p>NODAPL, C51, marches for science</p>
<h2 id="publicity-privacy">publicity &amp; privacy</h2>
<p>we want people to know things: when a march is happening, that the police are beating people, that the white house welcomes white supremacists</p>
<p>comes up against doxxing - publishing home addresses and contact information for harassment super common on twitter and pushes people away from it.</p>
<p>case study: a person want to organize their work environment - they want people involved to know and want to be known, want to be accessible to people with questions - do they want their information spread on social media without context as an &quot;agitator&quot; - will they be able to work again?</p>
<h2 id="consequences">consequences</h2>
<p>patriarchy and white privilege totally work into this as who is outspoken about which issues plays hugely differently. colleagues who are white and male rabble-rousers get a reputation but can still get work because they're outspoken - colleagues who are trans people of colour calling out sexist white dudes never work in the industry again.</p>
<h2 id="convenience-security">convenience &amp; security</h2>
<p>capitalism makes some things easy for us and some things difficult</p>
<p>we have to be wary of solutions that are provided that say they'll completely cover both ends of this spectrum</p>
<p>so many passwords</p>
</section>
<section id="threat-models" class="slide level1">
<h1>threat models</h1>
<p>When we discuss information security, who are your adversaries? what</p>
<ul>
<li>family and friends</li>
<li>employers</li>
<li>corporations</li>
<li>government agencies</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="tools" class="slide level1">
<h1>tools</h1>
<h2 id="general-privacy-basics">general privacy basics</h2>
<p>vs. people with access to your computer (family/friends/roommates)</p>
<ul>
<li>Incognito/Private browsing/clear history on close</li>
<li>different passwords for every account</li>
<li>unique, long, memorable</li>
<li>&quot;memorable&quot; usually means using a password manager to remember it for you (LastPass or KeePass)</li>
<li>don't let your browser remember your passwords</li>
<li>SnapChat or WhatsApp delete messages right away</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="privacy-from-employers">privacy from employers</h2>
<p>don't use a work computer for your communication</p>
<ul>
<li>traffic is easily tracked even if you are using incognito mode/private browsing - IP addresses show up places (twitterbots like https://twitter.com/gccaedits )</li>
<li>use https to encrypt so your passwords and info aren't being transmitted in cleartext</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="privacy-from-corporations">privacy from corporations</h2>
<p>really does the convenience vs privacy thing here. advertising and tracking is ubiquitous, so some of these practices will stop websites from working the way they want to.</p>
<ul>
<li>use an ad-blocker uBlock Origin</li>
<li>use Privacy Badger from eff.org</li>
<li>use https everywhere</li>
<li>duckduckgo or startpage for searching</li>
<li><p>encrypted cloud storage like Sync.com</p></li>
<li><p>turn off all your location tracking data on your phone, especially history</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="privacy-from-government-agencies">privacy from government agencies</h2>
<p>governments have resources to throw at this stuff. best practices make them use</p>
<ul>
<li>Tor browser</li>
<li>iPhone (5S or later but don't use the fingerprint ID)</li>
<li>Signal for communication (end to end encrypted)</li>
<li>â€‹</li>
